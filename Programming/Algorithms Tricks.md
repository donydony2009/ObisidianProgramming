- Producing a **cummulative array** can be done in O(n) by first counting the occurences and then summing them
- Finding a **majority** or even who took more than a third of votes can be done with **Boyerâ€“Moore majority vote algorithm** (essentially count++ if it's majority count-- otherwise and all the votes will eliminate each others until only the majority is left)

### Sorted Array
- 1 index parsing
- 2 index parsing
- Binary search

#### Binary Tree
- Closes element to the current node is either the rightmost node of the left child or  the leftmost node of the right child
